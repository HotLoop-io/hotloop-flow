// Package filescope bounds where the file nodes may read and write.
//
// Node-RED's file nodes take any path at all, which means "can edit a flow"
// implies "can read anything the process can read and write anything it can
// write". On a Pi in a workshop that is fine. In an App Store app on a
// customer's plant floor, where the editor is reachable by anyone with a
// dashboard login, it is a way to read a mounted Secret.
//
// So the file nodes are scoped. The default scope is the data directory — the
// PVC, where a flow's own files live and where they almost always belong — and
// an operator adds more roots deliberately. This is enabled rather than
// disabled by default, unlike the exec node: reading and writing files under
// your own PVC is the ordinary use, whereas running a command never is.
