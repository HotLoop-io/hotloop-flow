// Package shell decides what the exec node is permitted to run.
//
// This exists because of what the exec node is. Node-RED's threat model is that
// anyone who can deploy a flow already owns the box, and the exec node is the
// proof: it runs an arbitrary command line through a shell. That model held when
// Node-RED was a thing you ran on your own Pi. It does not hold for an App Store
// app on a customer's plant floor, where the editor is reachable by anyone with
// a dashboard login. And it isn't hypothetical: Pilz shipped Node-RED on its
// IndustrialPI 4 with no authentication, and that became CVE-2025-41656
// (CERT@VDE VDE-2025-045), anyone on the network running commands on the
// device. That CVE is Pilz's, not Node-RED's, but Node-RED's default is what
// they shipped.
//
// So the node ships disabled, an operator has to name the commands it may run,
// and there is no shell. Those three together mean a flow author cannot turn
// "can edit a flow" into "can run anything", which is the property that makes
// the node shippable at all.
