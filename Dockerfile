# Mirrors the industrial-dashboard build: a Go builder producing a static binary,
# then distroless. nodered/node-red:latest is roughly 450MB because it carries a
# Node.js runtime, an npm tree and a package manager; this carries a binary.

# and so Node never appears in the runtime image.

# CGO_ENABLED=0 is load-bearing, not a habit: it is what makes the binary static

# goja, wazero, pgx, paho — is pure Go specifically to keep this true.

# -trimpath strips build paths out of the binary so it does not leak the layout
# of the machine that built it, and makes the build reproducible.
