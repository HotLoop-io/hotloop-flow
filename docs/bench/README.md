# Benchmarks

Every comparative number in this repository came out of `hotloop-flow bench`. None
of them came off a forum.

That is the whole reason this directory exists. The throughput and memory
figures people quote for Node-RED are anecdotes — different hardware, different
flows, different Node versions, nothing controlled — and repeating one with our
name on it would be passing a rumour off as a measurement. So: one box, one
session, one load generator, one flow file, both runtimes.

## The flow

[`bench-flow.json`](bench-flow.json). Five nodes: an HTTP endpoint, three
property edits, a reply.

It is deployed to **both** runtimes **unchanged**. That is not a convenience, it
is the point — the file is Node-RED v1 and HotLoop Flow reads it as-is, so there is
no translation step to argue about. Both answer `ok` with a 200 to the same
request.

Nothing in the flow is fast on purpose. It is the shape of a small real flow,
which is what the comparison is supposed to be about.

## Running it

Both runtimes as containers, so the comparison is between two things deployed
the way they are actually deployed:

```bash
podman build -t localhost/hotloop-flow:bench .
podman pull docker.io/nodered/node-red:latest

mkdir -p /tmp/ewbench /tmp/nrbench
cp docs/bench/bench-flow.json /tmp/ewbench/flows.json
cp docs/bench/bench-flow.json /tmp/nrbench/flows.json

HASH=$(podman run --rm localhost/hotloop-flow:bench hash-password -password benchbench123)
podman run -d --name ew-bench -p 18811:1880 -v /tmp/ewbench:/data:Z \
  -e HOTLOOP_FLOW_DATA_DIR=/data -e HOTLOOP_FLOW_ADMIN_USER=admin \
  -e HOTLOOP_FLOW_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH="$HASH" \
  -e HOTLOOP_FLOW_CREDENTIAL_SECRET=bench-secret -e HOTLOOP_FLOW_LOG_LEVEL=warn \
  localhost/hotloop-flow:bench

podman run -d --name nr-bench -p 18812:1880 -v /tmp/nrbench:/data:Z \
  docker.io/nodered/node-red:latest
```

Then the same command against each, from the same shell:

```bash
hotloop-flow bench -mode http -target http://127.0.0.1:18811 -path /bench \
  -duration 30s -warmup 5s -connections 8
hotloop-flow bench -mode http -target http://127.0.0.1:18812 -path /bench \
  -duration 30s -warmup 5s -connections 8
```

Memory is not taken from this setup any more. It used to be read with
`podman stats`, and that turned out not to measure what the rows claimed; see
[Memory](#memory) for why and for how it's measured now.

The load generator is closed-loop: each client sends the next request when the
last one came back. That measures what the far end can absorb, which is the
question, and it cannot produce the misleading coordinated-omission latency an
open-loop generator reports when the target falls behind.

The five-second warm-up is discarded. Node's JIT needs it. Ours does not, and it
costs nothing to be even-handed about it.

## Results

**Measured 2026-08-08.** Linux, 12 CPUs, both runtimes in rootless podman on the
same host, `nodered/node-red:latest` (Node-RED 4.x), HotLoop Flow at `05d4235`.

| | HotLoop Flow | Node-RED | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image size | **25.1 MB** | 717 MB | 29× |
| Throughput | **3,460 req/s** | 1,290 req/s | 2.7× |
| Latency p50 | **1.03 ms** | 4.61 ms | 4.5× |
| Latency p95 | **9.19 ms** | 14.72 ms | 1.6× |
| Latency p99 | **16.72 ms** | 23.14 ms | 1.4× |
| Cold start | **2.1–2.3 s** | 4.6–5.5 s | ~2.3× |

Requests completed in the 30-second window: 103,800 against HotLoop Flow, 38,700
against Node-RED.

### What these numbers are not

**Cold start includes container start.** Roughly two seconds of it is podman
bringing up the container, and that is common to both — so the runtime-only
difference is the delta, about 2.5–3 seconds, not the ratio.

**Throughput here includes the HTTP stack.** That is deliberate: it is the only
surface both runtimes present identically, and it is what somebody using the app
experiences. It is not a measurement of either scheduler in isolation. For that:

```
hotloop-flow bench -mode engine -chain 5 -messages 200000
```

which pushes messages through a five-node chain with no I/O in the path and
reports messages per second, nanoseconds per message, and bytes allocated per
message. There is no equivalent for Node-RED, so **that number is never quoted
comparatively.**

**One flow shape, one payload size, one concurrency.** A flow doing real I/O —
an MQTT publish, a database write — would be dominated by the I/O and both
runtimes would converge. The claim being made is about the runtime's own
overhead, not about every workload.

**The p95 and p99 gaps are much smaller than the p50 gap.** Worth saying out
loud rather than quoting the p50 alone: under saturation both runtimes queue,
and queueing dominates the tail. The median is where the difference in
per-request cost actually shows.

## Memory

This run's table used to carry two memory rows: 4.8 MB idle and 12.3 MB under
load for HotLoop Flow, 54.6 MB and 179.6 MB for Node-RED, all read off
`podman stats` as described above. They're gone. `podman stats` reports what the
kernel charges to the container, not what the process has resident, and the
4.8 MB never reproduced for anyone. Remeasured on 2026-09-28, the
published 2.0.4 image read 2.6 MB in `podman stats` while the same process had
14.7 MB in `VmRSS`. A figure that moves that far with the tool isn't one to
print next to a ratio.

What goes here instead is the process's own RSS, from the native binary with no
container, using the harness's `-launch` mode:

```bash
cd web && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o hotloop-flow ./cmd/hotloop-flow

W=$(mktemp -d); cp hotloop-flow "$W/"; cp docs/bench/bench-flow.json "$W/flows.json"; cd "$W"
export HOTLOOP_FLOW_DATA_DIR="$W" HOTLOOP_FLOW_ADMIN_USER=admin \
  HOTLOOP_FLOW_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH="$(./hotloop-flow hash-password -password benchbench123)" \
  HOTLOOP_FLOW_CREDENTIAL_SECRET=bench-secret HOTLOOP_FLOW_LOG_LEVEL=warn \
  HOTLOOP_FLOW_HOST=127.0.0.1 HOTLOOP_FLOW_PORT=18897

./hotloop-flow bench -mode http -launch ./hotloop-flow -target http://127.0.0.1:18897 \
  -path /bench -duration 30s -warmup 5s -connections 8
```

`-launch` starts the binary, waits for the flow to answer, sleeps two seconds and
reads `VmRSS` from `/proc` (idle), then samples it through the load and keeps the
peak (under load). Linux only, since that's where `/proc` is.

**Measured 2026-09-28.** Linux under WSL2, 24 CPUs (Ryzen 9 7900X), built from
`main` at `5469d34`. Three runs:

| | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| RSS, idle | 16.7 MiB | 16.6 MiB | 16.5 MiB |
| RSS, peak under load | 26.6 MiB | 26.2 MiB | 27.5 MiB |

There's no Node-RED column because nobody has run Node-RED through `-launch` on
the same box yet, and dividing this by a number that came from a different
measurement is exactly the mistake this section exists to undo. So it's quoted
as an absolute number, not a ratio.

## Re-running after a change

The numbers above are pinned to a commit. If the engine changes, re-run before
editing them, and re-run **both sides in the same session** — a Node-RED figure
carried over from an earlier run on a differently-loaded box is exactly the kind
of number this directory exists to avoid.
